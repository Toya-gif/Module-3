---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to reverse the members of a given list.

---

### ALGORITHM

Start

1.Input an integer n (number of elements in the list).
2.Initialize an empty list a.
3.Repeat n times:
4.Input an integer and append it to list a.
5.Reverse the list a using slicing (a[::-1]).
6.Print the reversed list.
7.End

---

### PROGRAM

```
a=[int(input()) for i in range(int(input()))]
print(a[::-1])
```
